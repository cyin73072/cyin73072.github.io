##### Keywords: Text Recognition, Text Cleaning, Text Summerization, Fine-tuning, OpenCV, Transformor, LSTM, GPT2, GPT3, OpenAI, Pytorch

The primary goal of this project was to devise an innovative system capable of automatically extracting and subsequently reconstructing textual information from fragments of torn paper. The system's success marked a notable transition from traditional manual methods to a more streamlined approach, leading to substantial savings in both time and resources.

By integrating cutting-edge assembly technology, which had previously been utilized predominantly for digital data reconstruction, the project addressed unique challenges inherent to physical paper. Through refining specific algorithms, the system was tailored to effectively handle these paper-based obstacles.

The practical implications of this advancement are profound, with potential applications spanning a variety of sectors including, but not limited to, document restoration, data recovery, and intelligence analysis. This development signifies a transformative step in how vital information from damaged documents can be extracted and processed.

##### Keywords: Text recognition, convolutional neural network, optical character recognition, CTPN, OpenCV

This project centered around harnessing the capabilities of deep learning models for practical real-world applications, specifically targeting damaged signs' text extraction.

The initial phase focused on object detection and segmentation techniques. By breaking down the damaged signs into individual letters, this provided a foundation for our test dataset. The subsequent phase involved generating synthetic letter images, serving as training data for our deep learning models. Once trained, the models were then employed to predict the content of the test data derived from damaged signs.

In essence, this research bridged advanced deep learning methodologies with the real-world challenge of reading and classifying text from signs that have endured damage, showcasing the versatility and potency of modern AI techniques.

##### Keywords: Abstractive text summarization, text classification, supreme court, justice decision prediction, course opinion, natural language pre-processing, transformer, TensorFlow Keras

The project embarked on the challenging endeavor of applying and enhancing machine learning models to achieve concise summarization of extensive legal documents, given the inherent need for these documents to address potential ambiguities with comprehensive detail. Beyond mere summarization, the project ambitiously sought to leverage machine learning to extract and predict case decisions directly from the document content.

While the prediction model's accuracy was not entirely within the anticipated parameters, it exhibited promising alignment with the underlying case facts. This suggests that with the acquisition of more extensive data, the project's objectives of accurate decision derivation are attainable in future iterations.

##### Keywords: Music Genre Recognition, Principal Component Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks,L1 regularization, L2 regularization

This project, split into two distinct parts, began by focusing on the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). We mathematically derived the gradient descent update rule directly from PCA's objective function. However, upon comparison, it was evident that this method lagged behind the Eigen-decomposition technique and the pre-implemented PCA library, both in terms of computational speed and reconstruction error.

In the subsequent phase, the project pivoted to explore the potentials of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the task of Music Genre Classification. After experimenting with various ANN architectures, we identified that a Pyramid-Shaped 3-layer ANN equipped with a sigmoid activation function was the most efficient for our specific goal. This optimized model demonstrated a promising accuracy of 0.567 when tasked with classifying music genres, utilizing the small subset of the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset.
